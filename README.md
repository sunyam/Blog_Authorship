Deep Learning to predict a blogger's age and gender

Using Deep Learning coupled with classification, on Natural Language, to predict the age/gender of the blogger given its posts/blog.

Will be using the super-powerful word2vec deep learning model, developed by Google. More info about that can be found here: https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/

Dataset that I'd be using for this problem can be found here: http://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~koppel/BlogCorpus.htm

Language: Python

This project is broadly based on this paper by Schler et al. http://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~schlerj/schler_springsymp06.pdf
